Today, <a href="https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy" target="_blank">Dinghy</a> released version 4.0 of their software, based on <a href="https://docs.docker.com/machine/" target="_blank">Docker Machine</a> rather than Vagrant. We are really excited about this, because of some of the shortcomings of vagrant-based VM's, and because of the new features and capabilities Docker Machine.

## Install the brew package

It's quite easy to setup and get going. If you've previously installed Dinghy, do the following:

```bash
cd `brew --prefix`/var/dinghy/vagrant && vagrant destroy
rm -rf `brew --prefix`/var/dinghy/vagrant
cd ~
brew reinstall --HEAD https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy/raw/latest/dinghy.rb
```

If you are new to Dinghy, install it with the following:

```bash
brew install --HEAD https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy/raw/latest/dinghy.rb
```

## Create the Dinghy VM

Our next step is to create the dinghy VM. This creates a VM that is based on VirtualBox and docker machine. Please note it will take a few minutes for this command to complete:

```bash
dinghy create --provider virtualbox
```

After a successful VM creation, you'll receive shell output similar to the following:

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/your-username/.docker/machine/machines/dinghy
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME=dinghy
```

Be sure to add these lines to your `~/.bash_profile` file. Also, don't copy/paste the above because these lines change for each specific install. (If you have preexisting variables form a previous installation of Dinghy, remember to remove those first).

## Test the installation

You may now test the installation. An easy way is to run:

```bash
docker ps
```

This will show all of your docker images. Let's try testing it out by dropping into a PHP shell:

```bash
docker run -it php
```

## Explore all features

Dinghy is a great tool for working with Docker on OS X, and especially Magento 2 because of the very large filesystem, and need for NFS. Be sure to check out all of these features on <a href="https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy" target="_blank">their GitHub page</a>:

- DNS Resolution
- HTTP Proxy
- Docker Machine integration
