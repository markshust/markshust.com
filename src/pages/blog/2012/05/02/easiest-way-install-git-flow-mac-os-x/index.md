I've recently switched all of my git repositories to use something called git flow. Found this browsing around, and it's a WAY simpler development process than what I've been doing. Basically, it rebases, merges, creates and deletes branches for you.

**Download and install GCC:**

**Download and install Homebrew:**

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)"`

**Then install git flow:**

`brew install git-flow`

**Some basic reading material here:**

I highly suggest to everyone using git to install this and start using it immediately, as the current process is most likely killing your dev process. Here is also a good video that visually explains the process of git flow on <a href="http://vimeo.com/16018419" target="_blank">Vimeo</a>.
