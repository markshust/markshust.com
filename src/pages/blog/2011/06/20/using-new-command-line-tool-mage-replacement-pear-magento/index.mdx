Magento had a great command line tool built into it's software build called 'pear' that was located in the root folder of Magento installations. Well... it's still there, it has just been renamed 'mage' and comes with different commands to update modules, the core, etc.

Your first step in using 'mage' is to set the proper permissions to make it executable by the executing user. This can be done with chmod from the root of your Magento install:

`chmod 550 mage`

Then, to run it, just type `./mage` in shell. You will be presented with a list of arguments to pass to it:

```bash

uninstall            Un-install Package  
upgrade              Upgrade Package     
upgrade-all          Upgrade All Packages
```

This is pretty self explanatory. For example, to upgrade all of the packages in your install, run the following then follow the onscreen prompts:

`./mage upgrade-all`

Note that some of the commands have changed since 'pear', most notably how to download and install extensions. This has been changed with the new 2.0 version of extension packaging. First, lookup the V2.0 extension URL from Magento Connect. After you have that url (should look something like http://connect20.magentocommerce.com/community/extension_name), it's easy-peasy. This url supplies you with the format and naming of how to download your extension. Just take the query part of the url (`community/extension_name`), and you are left with the channel and package name delineated by the slash. Use this and you are set:

`./mage install http://connect20.magentocommerce.com/community extension_name`
