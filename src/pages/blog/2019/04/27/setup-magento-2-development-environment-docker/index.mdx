It can be very difficult to get a Magento 2 development environment setup quickly & easily. Back in the middle of 2015, I was trying to getting a jump-start on Magento 2 module development, but had a horribly hard time just getting Magento installed (these were the pre-2.0 GM days). I was passively watching a project that was new at the time called Docker, but I really wasn't familiar with it. It didn't matter though; I loved the concepts around containerization, and decided this was the path I was moving forward on.

I seriously locked myself in my office for almost a couple months (I was a freelancer working from home at the time, so I was able to do this). I came out to eat, drink and sleep, but that is about it. A few weeks in, I managed to see the home page of Magento 2 (albeit with a ton of JavaScript errors). A week later, I managed to make all of the errors go away, but had some workflow issues with volumes. After a total of six weeks... I was able to develop on Magento 2!

I did take the next day off to play some video games and eat some Chipotle.

Fast-forward almost four years, and <a href="https://github.com/markshust/docker-magento/" target="_blank">my Docker configuration for Magento</a> has almost 500 stars on GitHub (the most of any Magento + Docker repo on GitHub). I'm actually more impressed that it's been forked more than 200 times -- forking typically shows real actual use! The original old images were under the "Mage Inferno" name and were <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/mageinferno/" target="_blank">downloaded over 100,000 times</a>. I'm very happy and impressed with these numbers. If it seems as though I'm bragging, it's because I am. Creating and maintaining a completely free open-source library, one which I am not compensated for or hardly ever receive praise for, is extremely difficult. I've given up plenty of family outings and free time to maintain this library, and it's become a labor of love at this point.

I managed to do a complete rebuild of the filesystem approach this last December, and finally got it to the point where I am truly happy with the result. That said, this approach can be a bit difficult to pickup and implement across all of your team's projects. I kept hearing the same questions: "How do I use this with my existing project?", "How can I configure PHP with my own config files?", or "How do I get started?". So, I decided to make a completely free screencast course:

This course came out to 20 lessons, all about setting up a development environment for Magento using Docker. It's a very easy watch at just over 30 minutes of total content.

After posting the link to it on twitter, it immediately got over 50 retweets and 100 likes!
