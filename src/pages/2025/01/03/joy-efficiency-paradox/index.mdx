I had a breakthrough moment today that completely changed how I think about business efficiency.

For years, I've been obsessed with creating systems and processes. My whole business model at M.academy is built around breaking complex topics into atomic, systematic pieces. I automate what can be automated, delegate what can be delegated, and constantly optimize for efficiency.

But here's the thing: I've been struggling with letting go of certain tasks that, by all traditional business advice, I should definitely delegate.

Creating graphics is a perfect example. I have a great designer. They're better at design than I'll ever be. Delegating this work is the "efficient" choice.

Yet I love creating graphics. It brings me into a state of flow. It's calming. It's fun.

And I've been feeling guilty about that, because it's not the "efficient" way to run a business.

But today I realized something: I didn't start my business to build the most efficient company possible. I started it to have freedom and autonomy. To "retire a little bit every day." To make my own rules.

So why am I letting someone else's rules about efficiency stop me from doing something I enjoy?

## The Joy-Efficiency Paradox

Sometimes the most efficient path to happiness isn't the most efficient path for business. And that's okay.

If spending an hour creating graphics brings me joy and calm, isn't that actually serving my primary aim? Isn't that contributing to the kind of life I want to live?

One of the reasons I went into business for myself was to have full control and make up my own rules. So here's my new rule:

I maintain the right to do certain tasks myself because they bring me joy, even when they could be delegated more efficiently.

This isn't about being stubborn or controlling. It's about acknowledging that business efficiency isn't the only metric that matters. Personal fulfillment, joy, and calm are valid business metrics too.

Maybe you're like me. Maybe you're holding onto certain tasks that you "should" delegate. Maybe you're feeling guilty about not following the traditional business playbook.

Consider this your permission slip to sometimes choose the less efficient path simply because it makes you happy.

The most systematic approach is sometimes to deliberately include some "inefficiencies" that contribute to personal happiness.

That's not breaking the system - that IS the system.

After all, efficiency without joy is just another form of constraint. And isn't breaking free from constraints why we started our own businesses in the first place?
