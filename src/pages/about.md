I have been working with PHP and eCommerce for over 20 years, with a specific emphasis on the Magento platform for the past decade. Having extensive experience with the LAMP stack, I've worked my way up from an entry-level programmer, to a solution architect, to running my own business. Over the years, I was able to achieve multiple certifications from both Zend and Adobe as a certified developer. I've been a presenter and have spoken at numerous Magento conferences like Magento Imagine and Meet Magento, and am a big proponent of using the platform in accordance with best practices.

As an advocate for free and open-source software, I've also been instrumental in maintaining [docker-magento](https://github.com/markshust/docker-magento), which has become the most popular and used Magento 2 development environment in the ecosystem. My wife, Juliann, and our two daughters, Lily and Brielle, are my greatest passion in life, and help balance my enthusiasm for technology. I'm a native Clevelander and enjoy Chipotle burritos, driving my 240sx, solving Rubik's cubes, and rooting for the Cleveland Browns.
